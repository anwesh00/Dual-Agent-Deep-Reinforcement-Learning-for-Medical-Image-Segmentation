# Dual-Agent-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-for-Medical-Image-Segmentation
We propose a segmentation framework with two DRL agents: one detects tumor pixels, the other identifies non-tumor pixels. Given a tumor image, both agents analyze it in parallel, applying their policies. Through collaboration and competition, they resolve conflicts to produce accurate and reliable tumor segmentation.
